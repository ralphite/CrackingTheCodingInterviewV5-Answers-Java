label the 100 lockers as 1,2,3,...,99,100

for locker k, let s be a set containing all
numbers divisible by k b/t 1 and k inclusive
then k is toggled size(s) times, only when k
is the square of an int the locker k will be
open after 100 rounds. so after 100 rounds
the open lockers are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49,
64, 81, 100. after the 100 rounds locker 1 is
toggled again so locker 1 is closed. now we 
have 9 lockers left which are open.
